                    brazilian, i live in São Leopoldo city, a southern city known for being
                    the cradle of German colonization. Due circumstances, I didn't show much
                    intelligence or aptitude for areas like mathematics and science, but today
                    I'm very interested in the scientific and tecnological field.

                <h1 class="textPainting">I graduated as a Systems Development Technician from Senac São Leopoldo.
                    The technical course lasted a year and a half and introduced me comprehensively to the IT market.
                    I say "the course introduced me comprehensively" because I had already taken three short courses,
                    also offered by Senac São Leopoldo, which initially introduced me to the field: an introduction to 
                    programming logic, an introduction to software testing, and an introduction to the Python language.
                    I still plan to pursue a degree in Computer Science because I want to pursue a career in research.

            <div class="painting" style="margin-top:149%;margin-left:9%;">
                <h1 class="textPainting">During my studies, I worked extensively with VS Code,
                    a widely used code editor for code development. I worked with languages ​​like
                    HTML and CSS to initially develop simple static websites, but I also used Javascript
                    to develop more dynamic and feature-rich websites. A website I developed during my Front-end 
                    classes, which I still use today, is my portfolio website—the one you're using now which I use 
                    to showcase my work as a developer. In addition to websites, I also worked with API systems developed 
                    in Typescript, which integrated websites with databases, primarily related to user registration and login, 
                    which primarily involved user CRUD and tools like Bcrypt to encrypt passwords in the database. The database 
                    used throughout the technical course was MySQL. I also worked with user experience, which involved design and 
                    color theory. Some of my colleagues didn't appreciate or value these topics much, but I still deeply value them 
                    because I know that the main goal of an app or website is to please customers or users, and I think user experience
                    is a good way to think like a user. I used Figma primarily to create interface mockups before developing the actual 
                    website or app, to ensure it was as user-friendly as possible.
